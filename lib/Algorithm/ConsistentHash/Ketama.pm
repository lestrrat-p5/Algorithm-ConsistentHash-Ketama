=head1 NAME

Algorithm::ConsistentHash::Ketama - Ketama Consistent Hashing for Perl (XS)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Algorithm::ConsistentHash::Ketama;

    my $ketama = Algorithm::ConsistentHash::Ketama->new();

    $ketama->add_bucket( $key1, $weight1 );
    $ketama->add_bucket( $key2, $weight2 );
    $ketama->add_bucket( $key3, $weight3 );
    $ketama->add_bucket( $key4, $weight4 );

    my $key = $ketama->hash( $thing );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WARNING: Alpha quality code -- and I wrote it for the heck of it, so no
guarantees as of yet. Patches, tests welcome.

This module implements just the libketama algorithm. You can specify a list of
"buckets", and then you can get the corresponding bucket name back when you
hash a string.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new instance of Algorithm::ConsistentHash::Ketama

=head2 clone

Clones the current object.

=head2 add_bucket( $key, $weight )

Adds a bucket to the list. C<$key> is the name of the bucket, and C<$weight>
denotes the weight of the C<$key>.

=head2 hash( $string )

Returns the corresponding bucket name (which you gave when you did add_bucket).

=head2 remove_bucket( $key )

Removes the given bucket from the list

=head2 buckets()

Returns a list of Algorithm::ConsistentHash::Ketama::Bucket objects

=head2 hash_with_hashnum( $string )

This is an advanced function. Reach for it only if you know exactly
why you need it.

Returns both the label (as with the hash() function) AND the computed internal
hash. This internal hash number can be used to look up the label again without
recomputing the hash.

=head2 label_from_hashnum( $hash )

Given a number, returns the label associated with that hash number. Only
hashes returned by hash_with_hashnum are permissible.
